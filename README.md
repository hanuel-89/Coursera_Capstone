# Coursera IBM Data Science Capstone Project
This repository contains the capstone project for my IBM Data Science course on Coursera. 
### The Problem

For this project, the business problem is best formulated as the question:

__Which AirBnB apartment should an Asian tourist choose to reside in during a visit to Paris city in
order to enjoy Asian cuisines located nearby?__

This question was answered by using [Foursquare's Location API](https://foursquare.com) to find the location of restaurants of Asian restaurants in Paris and AirBnB apartments.

Details of the report is provided in ```Asian_Tourist_in_Paris_report.pdf```

Thank you.
